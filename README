Bot::JabberBot version 0.01
==========================

Bot::JabberBot provides a simple object interface to a jabber bot, 
very similar to Bot::BasicBot for IRC bots. It will be superseded by
a larger POE-based bot framework providing support for different IM 
protocols and other net access protocols, with state in a central bot 
core.

To use a Bot::JabberBot you must register an account for it with a jabber 
server through a regular client, and set up transports to other IM accounts
in this way. i thought of doing this automatically, but decided it would
be spammy and might lead to bot abuse.
